# Hi everyone  &#128400;

I am Ludovic, I live in France and more specifically in Dijon. I'm a **young developer** working with PHP and React. I would like to improve my skills in these two languages.
I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general.<br>
I hope to be able to show you my skills in these different areas soon.
